            <h3>1) What is Python? What are its benefits?</h3>
            <p>
                Python was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>, and released in <strong>1991</strong>. 
                It is a high level, general purpose, interpreted programming language. Python's object-oriented 
                programming features, modules, threads, and exception handling make it a powerful language for 
                creating complex applications that model real-world problems. Python's automatic memory management 
                eliminates the need for manual memory allocation, which can be a time-consuming and error-prone 
                process.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Benefits of Python Programming Language:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python is a versatile programming language that features a straightforward and uncomplicated 
                    syntax, making it easy to learn and understand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The language prioritizes code readability and, therefore, minimizes the time and expenses 
                    associated with maintaining programs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Python can be used for scripting and is entirely free and open-source, with various 
                    third-party packages that support code reuse and modularity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
                    have attracted a vast community of developers who use Python for Rapid Application 
                    Development and deployment.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>2) What is an Interpreted language?</h3>
            <p>
                An interpreted language is a programming language that does not require a separate compilation 
                step before running the program. Instead, the program is executed line by line, with the 
                interpreter interpreting and executing each line of code as it is encountered in the source code. 
                Examples of interpreted languages include Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby. Since interpreted 
                languages do not require a separate compilation step, they can be more flexible and easier to use 
                than compiled languages, but may be slower in some cases.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>3) What is dynamically typed language?</h3>
            <p>
                Python is a programming language that is interpreted, meaning that the code is executed 
                line by line as it is read, without the need for a separate compilation step. This means that 
                Python does not require the programmer to explicitly specify variable types before using them, 
                as the interpreter will check the types dynamically during execution. This makes Python a
                dynamically typed language, as the variable types can change at runtime. This approach allows
                for more flexibility and faster development times, but may lead to errors that would have 
            strongbeen caught by a compiler in statically typed languages.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>4) What is PEP 8?</h3>
            <p>
                PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, which is a formal document that provides information 
                and guidelines to the Python community on the design and implementation of new features and 
                processes in Python. PEP 8 is a particularly crucial document as it outlines the style guidelines 
                that should be followed when writing Python code. As a result, contributing to the Python
                open-source community requires strict adherence to these guidelines, ensuring that code is 
                consistent and readable for other developers who may work on the same project in the future.
            </p>

            <h3>5) What is namespace in Python? What are its types?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, a namespace is a mapping between names (or identifiers) and objects. Namespaces 
                are used to organize and control the visibility of names in a program.
            </p>
            <p><strong>In general, there are three types of namespaces in Python:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Built-in Namespace:</strong> This namespace contains built-in functions and types 
                    provided by Python, which are always available for use in any Python program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Global Namespace:</strong> This namespace contains names defined at the module level. 
                    These names are accessible from any part of the module.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local Namespace:</strong> This namespace is created when a function is called and 
                    contains names defined within that function. These names are only accessible within the 
                    function and are not visible outside of it.
                </li>
                <p>
                    When a name is referenced in a Python program, Python first searches the local namespace, 
                    then the global namespace, and finally the built-in namespace to resolve the name. This is 
                    known as the "LEGB" rule.
                </p>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>6) How memory is managed in Python?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Python's Memory Manager handles the memory management in Python. It allocates memory in 
                    the form of a private heap space that is exclusively used by Python. All the objects created 
                    in Python are stored in this heap, which is not accessible to programmers. However, Python 
                    does provide some core API functions to manipulate the memory in this heap space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Furthermore, Python also has a built-in garbage collection mechanism that automatically 
                    recycles the unused memory in the private heap space. This helps to free up memory that 
                    is no longer needed by the program, which improves the overall efficiency and performance 
                    of the program.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h3>7) What are Python literals?</h3>
            <p>
                Literals in Python are fixed values that are used to represent data types such as strings, 
                numbers, and boolean values.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>String Literals:</strong> String literals are used to represent text and are enclosed 
                    in either single or double quotes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Numerical Literals:</strong> Numeric literals are used to represent numeric values and 
                    can be of three types: integer, float, and complex. Integers are whole numbers without a 
                    decimal point, while floats are numbers with a decimal point. Complex numbers consist of a 
                    real part and an imaginary part.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Boolean Literals:</strong> Boolean literals are used to represent boolean values, 
                    which are either True or False. These values are used to indicate whether a statement is 
                    true or false.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Special Literals:</strong> Python contains one special literal called as 'None' which 
                    is used to represent a null variable. If 'None' is compared to anything other than 'None', 
                    it will return False.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>8) What is PYTHONPATH in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                PYTHONPATH is a configuration variable in the operating system's environment that can be set to 
                include additional directories where Python can look for modules and packages. This variable 
                allows you to add custom directories to the search path that Python uses to find modules, making 
                it easier to use and maintain Python libraries that are not installed in the default system 
                location.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you have a Python project that depends on a custom module or library that is not 
                part of the standard Python library, you can add the directory containing the module to the 
                PYTHONPATH environment variable. This will allow Python to find and import the module even though 
                it is not located in the default system path.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>9) What are Python modules? Name some commonly used built-in modules in Python.</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements, which can be imported 
                and used in other Python scripts. Modules help to organize the code and make it more manageable 
                and reusable.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>os:</strong> Provides a way to interact with the operating system.</li>
                <li><strong>math:</strong> Provides mathematical functions.</li>
                <li><strong>datetime:</strong> Provides classes for working with dates and times.</li>
                <li><strong>random:</strong> Provides functions for generating random numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>json:</strong> Provides functions for working with JSON data.</li>
                <li><strong>csv:</strong> Provides functions for working with CSV files.</li>
                <li><strong>numpy:</strong>Provides support for multidimensional arrays and mathematical operations on them.</li>
                <li><strong>pandas:</strong> Provides tools for data analysis and manipulation.</li>
                <li><strong>matplotlib:</strong>Provides tools for creating visualizations such as graphs and charts.</li>
                <li><strong>requests:</strong> Provides functions for making HTTP requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are many other useful Python modules available, and which one to use depends on the specific 
                task 
                or project.

        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>10) What are Python functions?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It takes inputs, performs 
                some computations, and returns output. Functions help us to organize our code and make it reusable. 
                Python has three types of functions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Built-in Functions:</strong> These are the functions that come pre-installed with Python. 
                    For example, the print() function is a built-in function that prints output to the console. 
                    Other examples of built-in functions are len(), type(), range(), etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User-defined Functions:</strong> These are the functions that are defined by the users to 
                    perform specific tasks. The syntax for defining a user-defined function is as follows:
                </li>
                <p class="code"><!--Add Image of syntax later-->
                    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    def function_name(parameters): <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""docstring""" <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# function code <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return output
                </p>
                <li>
                    <strong>Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions):</strong> These are the functions that are defined 
                    without a name. They are also called lambda functions. The syntax for defining a lambda 
                    function is as follows:
                </li>
                <p>lambda parameters: expression</p>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>11) What are global variables and local variables?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, global variables are variables that are defined outside of any function or class, 
                and can be accessed and modified by any part of the program. Local variables, on the other hand, 
                are variables that are defined within a function or class, and can only be accessed within that 
                function or class.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example to illustrate the difference:</p>
            <p class="code"><!-- Add Image of syntax later-->
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Global variable <br>
                name = "John" <br>
                                <br>
                def print_name(): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Local variable <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age = 25 <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("My name is", name) <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("I am", age, "years old") <br>
                print_name()
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above code, 'name' is a global variable that can be accessed within the 'print_name()' 
                function. 'age', on the other hand, is a local variable that is defined only within the 
                'print_name()' function and cannot be accessed outside of it.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Loacal variable <br>
                count = 0 <br>
                def increment_count(): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global count <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count += 1 <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment_count() <br>
                print(count) # Output: 1 <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above code, the 'global' keyword is used to tell Python that 'count' refers to the global 
                variable and not a local variable with the same name. The 'increment_count()' function then modifies 
                the global variable 'count'.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>12) What are the types of parameter passing mechanisms in Python?</h3>
            <p>In Python, there are two types of parameter passing mechanisms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pass by reference:</strong> In Python, all variables are actually references to 
                    objects in memory. When a function is called and a parameter is passed by reference, the 
                    function receives a reference to the same object as the original variable. Any changes made 
                    to the parameter within the function are reflected in the original variable outside the 
                    function.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pass by value:</strong> In some cases, when a parameter is passed by value, a copy 
                    of the parameter's value is made and passed to the function. This means that any changes 
                    made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original variable outside the 
                    function.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It's important to note that even when a parameter is passed by value, if the value is an object 
                (such as a list or dictionary), the object itself is still passed by reference. This means that 
                changes made to the object within the function will be reflected in the original variable outside 
                the function.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Python, the default parameter passing mechanism is pass by reference. However, you can force 
                a parameter to be passed by value by making a copy of the parameter using the copy module or by 
                explicitly assigning a new value to the parameter within the function.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>13) What is type conversion in python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, type conversion (or typecasting) refers to the process of changing the data type 
                of a variable or an object to another data type. This is useful when you need to perform 
                operations on data of different types, or when you want to represent data in a different 
                format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python has a number of built-in functions that allow you to convert between data types. 
                Some of the most commonly used conversion functions are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>int():</strong> Converts a string or a float to an integer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>float():</strong> Converts a string or an integer to a floating-point number.

            <h3>14) What is the difference between Python Arrays and Lists?</h3>
            <p>Arrays and lists are both used to store a collection of items, but they have some key differences.
                Below are some of the main differences between Python arrays and lists:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Type of elements:</strong> The most significant difference between arrays and 
                    lists is the type of elements they can contain. In Python, lists can contain elements of 
                    different data types, such as integers, strings, and objects, whereas arrays can only 
                    contain elements of the same data type.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Size and memory allocation:</strong> Lists are dynamically sized, meaning you 
                    can add or remove elements from a list at any time. They are also allocated in memory 
                    in a way that allows them to grow or shrink as needed. Arrays, on the other hand, are 
                    typically fixed in size and must be allocated in memory with a specific size at the time 
                    of creation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance:</strong> Arrays are generally more performant than lists, especially 
                    when working with large collections of data, because they are allocated in contiguous 
                    blocks of memory. This makes it easier for the computer to access and manipulate the 
                    elements in the array. Lists, on the other hand, are implemented as linked lists, which 
                    can be slower to access and manipulate.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="code">

                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>

                my_array = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) <br>
                                                             <br>
                # creating a list of mixed data types <br>

            <h3>15) What is self in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, 'self' is a conventionally used variable name that represents the instance of a 
                class. It is typically the first parameter of any method defined within a class. When you 
                create an object of a class, the 'self' parameter refers to the specific instance of that 
                class. You can then use the 'self' keyword to access the instance variables and methods of 
                the class.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>16) What is __init__() ? Or How to overload constructors or methods in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, '__init__' is a special method (sometimes called a constructor) that is 
                automatically called when an object of a class is created. The purpose of '__init__' is to 
                initialize the object's attributes and set their initial values.
            </p>
            <p>
                The '__init__' method takes 'self' as its first parameter, which refers to the specific instance 
                of the class that is being created. You can then define any other parameters you want to use 
                to initialize the object's attributes. Below is an example of how '__init__' and 'self' are used 
                in a Python class:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                class Person: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def __init__(self, name, age): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.name = name <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.age = age <br>
                                                                                          <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def say_hello(self): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.") <br>
                                                                                            <br>
                # creating a Person object and calling its say_hello() method <br>
                p = Person("Alice", 25) <br>
                p.say_hello()  # output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old." <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above example, the '__init__' method takes 'self', 'name', and 'age' as parameters. When an 
                object of the 'Person' class is created, 'self' refers to that specific instance of the class, 
                while 'name' and 'age' are the values passed in when the object is created. The '__init__' method 
                then initializes the 'name' and 'age' attributes of the object with the values passed in. <br>
                The '__init__' method is an optional method in Python classes, but it is often used to ensure 
                that objects of a class are created with the correct initial state.

        <div>
            <h3>17) How does break and continue keywords work?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>break</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> are the two keywords in Python that are 
                used to control the flow of loops, such as for and while loops.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>break</strong> is used to immediately terminate a loop, even if the loop's condition 
                is still true. When <strong>break</strong> is encountered, the loop is exited and the program 
                continues executing from the next statement after the loop. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                for i in range(1, 11): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if i == 5: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break <br>
                print(i)
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the loop will print out the numbers 1 through 4, but when i equals 5, 
                the <strong>break</strong> statement is executed, and the loop is immediately terminated. 
                The program then continues executing from the next statement after the loop, which is nothing 
                in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>continue</strong>, on the other hand, is used to skip over the current iteration of a 
                loop and move on to the next iteration. When <strong>continue</strong> is encountered, 
                the remaining statements in the loop body for the current iteration are skipped, and the 
                loop condition is evaluated again for the next iteration. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                for i in range(1, 11): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if i == 5: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(i) <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the loop will print out all the numbers from 1 through 10, except for 5. 
                When i equals 5, the <strong>continue</strong> statement is executed, which skips the 
                remaining statements in the loop body for that iteration and moves on to the next iteration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>break</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> are often used together with conditional 
                statements, such as <strong>if</strong> statements, to control the flow of a loop based on certain conditions. 
                They can help make loops more efficient and reduce the complexity of the code.

            <h3>18) What is slicing in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                Slicing is a technique in Python used to extract a portion of a sequence (such as a string, 
                list, or tuple) by specifying a range of indices. In Python, we can slice sequences using 
                the colon : operator inside square brackets [ ]. The general syntax for slicing is as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Syntax:</strong> 
                dataStructure[start:end:step]
            </p>
            <p>
                where:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        start: The index of the first element to be included in the slice (inclusive). 
                        If omitted, it defaults to 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        end: The index of the last element to be included in the slice (exclusive). If 
                        omitted, it defaults to the length of the sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        step: The number of indices to skip between each element in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Here are some examples of using slicing in Python:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                my_string = "Hello, World!" <br>
                my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                <br>
                # Slicing a string <br>
                print(my_string[0:5])    # Output: "Hello" <br>
                print(my_string[7:])     # Output: "World!" <br>
                print(my_string[::2])    # Output: "Hlo ol!" <br>
                <br>
                # Slicing a list
                print(my_list[1:3])      # Output: [2, 3] <br>
                print(my_list[:-1])      # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
                print(my_list[::2])      # Output: [1, 3, 5] <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>19) What does [::-1] do?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, <strong>[::-1]</strong> is a slicing notation used on a sequence, such as a list 
                or a string, to reverse the order of its elements. The notation <strong>[start:stop:step]</strong> 
                is used to slice a sequence from index <strong>start</strong> to index <strong>stop</strong> with a
                step of <strong>step</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the start and stop indices are not specified, the entire sequence is considered, and when 
                the step is negative, the sequence is traversed in reverse order. So, <strong>[:: -1]</strong> 
                means to start at the beginning of the sequence, end at the end of the sequence (implicitly), 
                and traverse the sequence backwards with a step of -1. Below is an example of using 
                <strong>[::-1]</strong> to reverse a list
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                myReversedList = myList [::-1] <br>
                print(myReversedList)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the original list ' [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ' is reversed using <strong>[::-1]</strong>, 
                and the resulting reversed list is ' [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] '. This slicing notation is commonly used 
                when we need to reverse a list or a string in Python.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>20) How can you randomize the items of a list in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, we can use the <strong>random</strong> module to randomize the items of a list. 
                The <strong>random</strong> module provides various functions to generate random numbers, 
                and we can use the <strong>shuffle()</strong> function from this module to shuffle the 
                items of a list randomly. The <strong>shuffle()</strong> function modifies the original 
                list in place, and it does not return anything. Here's an example of shuffling a list in
                Python:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                    import random <br>
                                  <br>
                    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                    random.shuffle(my_list) <br>
                    print(my_list)  # Output: [2, 1, 4, 3, 5] <br>                   
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, we first import the <strong>random</strong> module, then create a list 
                my_list containing some elements. We then call the <strong>shuffle()</strong> function from 
                the <strong>random</strong> module and pass the 'my_list' as an argument to it. This shuffles 
                the items of the 'my_list' list randomly. Finally, we print the shuffled list to the console.

            <h3>21) What are Python iterators?</h3>
            <p>
                An iterator is an object that allows us to traverse through the elements of a container, 
                such as a list or a string, one at a time. The iterator keeps track of its current position 
                in the container and returns the next element when asked.

            <h3>22) Which are the data structures that are available in Python?</h3>
            <p> Python provides several built-in data structures that are used to store and organize data 
                efficiently. Here are some of the most commonly used data structures in Python:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lists:</strong> Lists are mutable collections of elements that are ordered 
                        and can contain elements of different types. They are created using square brackets 
                        [] and can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements. Lists are often 
                        used to store and manipulate collections of data, such as a list of numbers or a list 
                        of names.
                        <p class="code">
                            <strong>Example:</strong> <br>

                        meaning they cannot be changed once created. They are created using parentheses () 
                        and are often used to represent a collection of related values, such as a date 
                        (day, month, year) or a 2D point (x, y).

            <h3>23) What is Pass in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, <strong>pass</strong> is a null statement, meaning that it doesn't do anything. 
                It is commonly used as a placeholder or a stub statement in situations where the programmer 
                needs to include a statement in the code to satisfy the syntax requirements of the language, 
                but doesn't yet know what the statement should do.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when defining a class or a function in Python, the body of the class or function 
                must have at least one statement. If you don't have any statements to include yet, you can 
                use <strong>pass</strong> as a placeholder until you write any logic. Below is an example of 
                using <strong>pass </strong> as a placeholder in a class definition:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                class MyClass: <br>
                def my_method(self): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>MyClass</strong> class has a method called <strong>my_method</strong>, 
                but the method body contains only <strong>pass</strong>. This is because the programmer hasn't yet decided what the method should do, but they still need to include a statement in the method body to satisfy the syntax requirements of the language.

            <h3>24) What is docstring in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                A docstring is a string literal that appears as the first statement in a module, function, 
                class, or method definition. It is used to document the purpose and usage of the code, and 
                to provide information about the input and output parameters, as well as any exceptions that 
                the code may raise. A docstring can be a single-line or multi-line string and it starts  with " " " 
                & ends with " " " .
               
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                def my_function(param1, param2): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" " " <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This function takes two parameters, param1 and param2, <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and returns their sum. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" " " <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return param1 + param2 <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the docstring provides a brief description of what the function does, 
                what parameters it takes, and what it returns.

            <h3>25) What is a negative index in Python and why it is used?</h3>
            <p>
                Negative indexing refers to the practice of using negative numbers to index a sequence, 
                such as a string or a list. In this context, the last element in the sequence has an index 
                of -1, the second-to-last element has an index of -2, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Negative indexing is useful when you want to access elements of a sequence starting from 
                the end, rather than from the beginning. It can be particularly useful when working with 
                sequences of unknown length, where you don't know the position of the last element. Here's an 
                example of using negative indexing to access elements of a string:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                my_string = "Hello, world!" <br>
                print(my_string[-1])    # Output: "!" <br>
                print(my_string[-2])    # Output: "d" <br>
                print(my_string[-3])    # Output: "l" <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, we use negative indexing to access the last character of the string, as well 
                as the second-to-last and third-to-last characters. Negative indexing can also be used in 
                conjunction with slicing to extract a subset of the sequence. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                print(my_list[-3:])    # Output: [3, 4, 5] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, we use negative indexing in combination with slicing to extract the last 
                three elements of the list.

            <h3>26) What are Python packages?</h3>
            <p>
                A package is a collection of related modules (Python files) that can be used together as a 
                single unit. A package typically includes a set of related functions, classes, and variables 
                that provide a specific functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packages are organized using a directory hierarchy, where each subdirectory represents a 
                package. The top-level package is typically represented as a directory in the file system, 
                and can contain one or more subpackages, as well as individual modules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Packages are used to organize code, make it reusable, and simplify the import process. 
                By grouping related modules into a package, you can avoid naming conflicts and create a 
                logical structure for your code.

            <h3>27) How can files be deleted in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                You can delete a file using the <strong>os</strong> module, which provides a set of 
                functions for interacting with the file system. To delete a file using the <strong>os</strong>
                module, you can use the <strong>os.remove()</strong> function, which takes the file path as 
                an argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's an example of how to use the <strong>os.remove()</strong> function to delete a file:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                import os <br>

            <h3>28) How to remove item from a array or a list in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, you can remove an item from a list using the <strong>remove()</strong> method or the del statement.
                Here's an example of how to use the <strong>remove()</strong> method to remove an item from a list:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # create a list <br>
                my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                        <br>
                # remove an item from the list <br>
                my_list.remove(3) <br>
                        <br>
                # print the updated list <br>
                print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>remove()</strong> method is called on the <strong>my_list</strong> list, passing in the value <strong>3</strong> as 
                an argument. This removes the first occurrence of <strong>3</strong> from the list.
                    <br>
                Alternatively, you can use the <strong>del</strong> statement to remove an item from a list by its index:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # create a list <br>
                my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                        <br>
                # remove an item from the list <br>
                del my_list[2] <br>
                        <br>
                # print the updated list <br>
                print(my_list) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>del</strong> statement is used to remove the item at 
                index <strong>2</strong> from the <strong>my_list</strong> list. This results in the same 
                output as the previous example.
            </p>

            <h3>29) What is split() used for?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, <strong>split()</strong> is a built-in string method used to split a string into 
                a list of substrings based on a specified separator i.e delimiter. The separator can be any 
                character or string that appears in the original string. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # create a string <br>
                my_string = "apple,banana,orange" <br>
                    <br>
                # split the string into a list of substrings <br>
                my_list = my_string.split(',') <br>
                    <br>
                # print the list <br>
                print(my_list) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>split()</strong> method is called on the <strong>my_string</strong> 
                variable with a comma separator specified as the argument. This splits the string into a list of 
                three substrings, each containing a fruit name.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>30) What is join() used for?</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>join()</strong> method in Python is a string method that is used to concatenate 
                a list of strings into a single string, using a specified delimiter. It takes an iterable 
                (e.g. a list or a tuple) of strings as input, and returns a single string that is the 
                concatenation of all the strings in the iterable, separated by the specified delimiter.
                Here is an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
                delimiter = ", " <br>
                joined_fruits = delimiter.join(fruits) <br>
                print(joined_fruits) # Output: "apple, banana, cherry" <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>join()</strong> method is used to concatenate the strings 
                <strong>"apple", "banana", and "cherry" </strong> into a single string, separated by the delimiter <strong>", "</strong>. 
                The resulting string <strong>"apple, banana, cherry"</strong> is then printed to the console.

            <h3>31) How to import Python modules?</h3>
            <p>
                Modules are separate files that contain Python code, and can be used to organize code and 
                make it easier to reuse. To import a module in Python, you can use the <strong>import</strong> 
                keyword followed by the name of the module.
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Import the entire module <br>
                import math <br>
                    <br>
                # Use a function from the module <br>
                x = math.sqrt(25) <br>
                print(x) # Output: 5.0 <br>
                        <br>
                # Import a specific function from the module <br>
                from math import sqrt <br>
                      <br>
                # Use the function <br>

            <h3>32) How is multithreading achieved in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                Multithreading in Python can be achieved using the <strong>threading</strong> module, 
                which provides a way to create and manage threads in a Python program. The <strong>threading</strong> 
                module provides a higher-level interface to threading than the lower-level <strong>_thread</strong> module.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the amount of true parallelism that can be
                achieved with multithreading, but multithreading can still be useful for certain types of 
                tasks, such as I/O-bound tasks or tasks that involve waiting for external events. To achieve 
                true parallelism in Python, multiprocessing can be used instead of multithreading.

            <h3>33) Which sorting technique is used by sort() and sorted() functions of Python?</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>sort()</strong> and <strong>sorted()</strong> functions of Python use the Timsort 
                algorithm for sorting. Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines insertion sort 
                and merge sort. It was designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data and is 
                known for its efficiency and stable performance. Timsort was developed by Tim Peters in 
                2002 for use in the Python standard library.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the <strong>sort()</strong> method is called on a list, it sorts the elements of the 
                list in place, whereas the <strong>sorted()</strong> function returns a new sorted list. 
                Here is an example of using the <strong>sorted()</strong> function to sort a list:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5] <br>
                                <br>
                sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers) <br>
                                <br>
                print(sorted_numbers) # [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the <strong>sorted()</strong> function is called on the "numbers" list, 
                which returns a new sorted list. The original "numbers" list remains unchanged.

            <h3>35) What is the difference between mutable datatypes and immutable datatypes in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, a datatype is said to be mutable if its value can be changed after it has been 
                created, while it is said to be immutable if its value cannot be changed after it has been 
                created.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Mutable datatypes in Python include lists, sets, and dictionaries. This means that you 
                    can change the elements of a list, add or remove items from a set, or add or remove
                    key-value pairs from a dictionary after it has been created. For example:
                    <p class="code">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                        my_list = [1, 2, 3] <br>
                        my_list[0] = 4 <br>
                        print(my_list) # [4, 2, 3] <br>
                                    <br>
                        my_set = {1, 2, 3} <br>
                        my_set.add(4) <br>
                        print(my_set) # {1, 2, 3, 4} <br>
                                    <br>
                        my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} <br>
                        my_dict['c'] = 3 <br>
                        print(my_dict) # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3} <br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Immutable datatypes in Python include strings, numbers, and tuples. This means that you 
                    cannot change the value of a string, number, or tuple after it has been created. For 
                    example:
                    <p class="code">
                        <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                        my_str = "hello" <br>
                        # my_str[0] = "H"   # Raises TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment <br>
                        my_str = "Hello"   # This creates a new string with the value "Hello" <br>
                                    <br>

            <h3>36) What is the difference between set and dictionary?</h3>
            <p>
                Both sets and dictionaries are built-in data types in Python, but they have some differences:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Purpose:</strong> The main purpose of a set is to store a collection of 
                        unique elements, while a dictionary is used to store key-value pairs, where each 
                        key has an associated value
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Syntax:</strong> A set is defined using curly braces {} with comma-separated 
                        values, while a dictionary is defined using curly braces {} with comma-separated 
                        key-value pairs in the form of key: value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Indexing:</strong> A set is an unordered collection, so its elements cannot 
                        be accessed using an index. On the other hand, a dictionary is indexed using its keys 
                        to retrieve their corresponding values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mutability:</strong> Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove 
                        elements from them. Dictionaries are also mutable, but you can only modify their 
                        values, not their keys.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Duplicates:</strong> Sets don't allow duplicates, while dictionaries can 
                        have duplicate values, but not duplicate keys
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Here's an example code snippet to illustrate the difference between sets and dictionaries:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Example of a set <br>
                my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2} <br>
                print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} <br>
                                    <br>
                # Example of a dictionary <br>
                my_dict = {'apple': 2, 'banana': 3, 'orange': 4} <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                In the example above, the set <strong>my_set</strong> only contains unique elements, while 
                the dictionary <strong>my_dict</strong> contains key-value pairs.

            <h3>37) What is list comprehension? Give an example.</h3>
            <p>
                List comprehension is a concise way of creating a new list by performing operations on each 
                item of an existing list or an iterable. It is a powerful tool in Python for creating lists 
                in a single line of code. Here is an example of list comprehension:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 <br>
                squares = [i*i for i in range(1, 11)] <br>
                print(squares) <br>
                # Output [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above example, a new list "squares" is created using list comprehension. The 
                expression "i*i" performs the operation of squaring each number in the range "1" to "10", 
                and the resulting squares are added to the list. The "for" loop iterates through each number 
                in the range, and the square of each number is added to the list using the <strong>append()</strong> method.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>38) What is dictionary comprehension? Give an example.</h3>
            <p>
                Dictionary comprehension is a concise way of creating a new dictionary by performing 
                operations on each key-value pair of an existing dictionary or an iterable. It is a powerful 
                tool in Python for creating dictionaries in a single line of code. Here is an example of 
                dictionary comprehension:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                # Create a dictionary of squares of numbers from 1 to 10 <br>
                squares = {i: i*i for i in range(1, 11)} <br>
                print(squares) <br>
                # Output {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100} <br>

            <h3>39) What is a generator in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                A generator is a special type of function which doesn't return a single value instead it 
                returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In generator, <strong>yield</strong> 
                statement is used instead of <strong>return</strong> statement.

            <h3>40) Whether tuple comprehension is possible?</h3>
            <p>
                No, tuple comprehension is not possible in Python. Unlike lists and dictionaries, which 
                have comprehensions, tuples do not support comprehension. However, it is possible to create 
                a tuple using a generator expression.

            <h3>41) What is a lambda function?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, a lambda function is a small anonymous function that can have any number of 
                arguments, but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when 
                the lambda function is called.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lambda functions are often used as a way to create short, throwaway functions that can be 
                used in situations where defining a regular function would be overkill. They are also 
                frequently used in functional programming, where functions are treated as values that can 
                be passed around and manipulated like any other data type. Here's an example of a simple 
                lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                sum = lambda x, y: x + y <br>
                print(sum(2, 3))   # Output: 5 <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, <strong>lambda x, y: x + y</strong> creates an anonymous function that 
                takes two arguments "x" and "y", and returns their sum. The resulting function is then 
                assigned to the variable <strong>sum</strong>, which can be called like any other function. 
                When <strong>sum(2, 3)</strong> is called, the lambda function is evaluated and returns the 
                result "5".

            <h3>42) What is swapcase() in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>swapcase()</strong> is a built-in Python string method that returns a new string by 
                swapping the case of each character in the original string. This means that any uppercase 
                characters in the original string will be converted to lowercase, and any lowercase 
                characters will be converted to uppercase. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong><br>
                text = "Hello, World!" <br>
                new_text = text.swapcase() <br>
                print(new_text)   # Output: hELLO, wORLD! <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example, the original string <strong>text</strong> contains both uppercase and 
                lowercase characters. When we call <strong>swapcase()</strong> on this string, each 
                character's case is swapped, resulting in the new string <strong>new_text</strong> with all 
                uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa
            </p>

            <h3>43) What is monkey patching in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                In Python, monkey patching refers to the ability to dynamically modify an existing class or 
                module at runtime by changing or adding its attributes, methods or functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technique can be useful in situations where you want to modify the behavior of a class 
                or function that you don't have the source code for, or where you need to make a temporary 
                modification for testing or debugging purposes

                        meet the condition specified in the function.

            <h3>45) How exception handling is done in Python?</h3>
            <p>
                Exception handling is a way to handle errors or exceptions that occur during program 
                execution. In Python, exceptions are raised when an error or unexpected situation occurs 
                during program execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                To handle exceptions in Python, we use the <strong>try</strong> and <strong>except</strong> 
                blocks. The code that may raise an exception is written inside the <strong>try</strong> block.
                If an exception is raised during the execution of the code inside the <strong>try</strong> 
                block, the program control is transferred to the <strong>except</strong> block where we can 
                handle the exception. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also use the <strong>finally</strong> block to ensure that certain code is executed 
                regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. The <strong>finally</strong> block is 
                executed after the <strong>try</strong> and <strong>except</strong> blocks. Here is an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                try: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# code that may raise an exception <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x = int(input("Enter a number: ")) <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = 1/x <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print(y) <br>
                except ZeroDivisionError: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Cannot divide by zero") <br>
                except ValueError: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.") <br>
                finally: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Program execution complete")
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above example, we are trying to divide 1 by the number entered by the user. We use 
                the <strong>try</strong> block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution 
                of this code. If the user enters 0, a <strong>ZeroDivisionError</strong> is raised. If the 
                user enters a non-numeric value, a <strong>ValueError</strong> is raised. We handle these 
                exceptions separately in the <strong>except</strong> blocks. "Program execution complete" 
                is printed after the <strong>try</strong> and <strong>except</strong> blocks have executed, 
                regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.

                You can display the current date and time in Python using the datetime module. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                import datetime <br>
                            <br>
                # get the current date and time <br>
                now = datetime.datetime.now() <br>
                                <br>
                # display the date and time in a specific format <br>
                print("Current date and time: ") <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                This will output the current date and time in the format <strong>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</strong>, for example:

            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>

                libraries that are not part of the Python standard library. PIP allows users to install and 
                uninstall packages, search for packages, and upgrade packages to their latest versions. It 
                is a command-line tool that is used by developers to manage Python packages and dependencies 
                in their projects. PIP is pre-installed in most of the recent versions of Python, but can

            <h3>48) Does Python support multiple inheritance?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, Python supports multiple inheritance, which means that a class can inherit attributes 
                and methods from multiple parent classes. In Python, a class can be derived from more than 
                one base class, by specifying multiple base classes in the class definition using a 
                comma-separated list of parent classes. Here's an example:
            </p>
            <p class="code">
                <strong>Example:</strong> <br>
                class A: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def method_A(self): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Method A") <br>
                             <br>
                class B: <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def method_B(self): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Method B") <br>
                            <br>
                class C(A, B): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def method_C(self): <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Method C") <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the above example, the class "C" is derived from both "A" and "B" classes. Therefore, 
                "C" will inherit all the methods and attributes from both "A" and "B" classes, along with 
                its own methods and attributes.

                structures and functions that make working with structured data more accessible and intuitive.
                Pandas allows for the import of data from various data sources, such as CSV, Excel, SQL 
                databases, and other file formats. The two primary data structures in Pandas are the Series 
                and DataFrame objects, which allow for the manipulation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional
                data, respectively. Pandas also provides functions for data cleaning, transformation, merging,
                and visualization. It is widely used in data analysis and scientific computing fields.

                A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure in pandas, which is similar to a 
                spreadsheet or SQL table. It is a table-like structure consisting of rows and columns. In a 
                DataFrame, each column can have a different data type, including integer, float, string, 
                and boolean. Also, each row has a unique index that starts from 0 by default.
            </p>

            <p>
                Python supports several databases, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>SQLite</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                    <li>Oracle Database</li>
                    <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
                    <li>MongoDB (a NoSQL database)</li>
                </ul>
                Python provides several modules to interact with databases, including sqlite3, 
                mysql-connector-python, psycopg2, cx_Oracle, pyodbc, and pymongo.
